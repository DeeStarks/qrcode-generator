# QR CODE GENERATOR
<hr>

This QR generator was written in Python. Feel free to fork make changes and send pull requests.

## Modules:
- `os`
- `PyQrCode`
- `DateTime`

If you have python installed, you probably have `os` and `datetime` already installed too. But if you run `pip show pyqrcode` and don't have it installed, you need to install with `pip install pyqrcode`.

After installing and running the code but get an error message like:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: Could not found module name 'png'
```
you have to install png using `pip install pypng'.
